# SQL_Employee_Tracker

## Description

As a business owner I want to be able to view and manage my departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I can run my business efficiently.

When I launch the program I am given the option to View tables, Add to tables, and Update tables.  Which will make my day to day easier, since I have the ability to see all the departments, roles, and employees at the same time and make updates using the convenient command prompt.

This was a great project, I had SQL knowledge going in but learning how to tie this to other projects/ other things we've learned is going to be beneficial in future endeavors.

## Installation

The git hub code can be found here:  https://github.com/swmcguire/SQL_Employee_Tracker.git

The video link can be found here: ![software demo video](./Assets/SQL_Employee_Video.webm)

In order to launch the program you'll have to navigate to the appropriate directory that houses the server.js file.

You'll have to run an npm install to envoke the different properties that are being used within the code.

Once this has been done, you'll be able to launch the software by using the 'node server.js' command.

This will launch the software and open a main menu screen of options which will allow you to toggle up and down through using the arrow keys.  

## Usage

Once the application has been launched you'll be brought to a main menu screen which you'll be able to toggle up and down through using the arrow keys. 

By toggling up and down using the arrow keys you'll be able to View the departments, view the roles, view the employees.  You'll also be able to Add to the department table, Add to the role table, Add to the Employee Table and Update the Employee Table.  When you select one of the updates/add options you'll be prompted to answer questions that will update/ add to the different databases.

When the questions have been answered the app will update the database and alert you that it has been updated.
